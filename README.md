# Timetable-Implementation-task

Showing how semantic HTML and styling CSS can form a well accessible timetable. 




## 🏗️ Implementation Details

  •HTML
- Used `<table>`, `<thead>`, and `<tbody>` for proper structure.
- Applied `<th scope="col">` for column headers and `<th scope="row">` for row headers.
- Used `rowspan` and `colspan` where breaks, lunch, or activities span across rows/columns.
- Organized timetable by **days (Mon–Fri)** and **year groups (Yr 7–Yr 11)**.

   •CSS
- Consistent table layout with `border-collapse`.
- Sans-serif font for readability.
- High-contrast header row (dark background, white text).


## ♿ Accessibility Features
- Screen-reader support through `scope="row"` and `scope="col"` attributes.
- Semantic separation of `<thead>` and `<tbody>`.
- Alt text provided for timetable preview image in this README.
- Color-coded highlights paired with bold text (not color alone).
